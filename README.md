# ImmageCropper
This app takes in the file name of an image. This file must be stored in the [IMAGES] folder in the same folder ass the app. 

The app then displays the image.

The app takes two clicks from the user (c1, c2), and crops the image at those two points with c1 being the top left point of the cropped image and c2 being the bottom right of the cropped image.

The user can choose to save the cropped image into the [IMAGES/CROPPED IMAGES] folder, or to recrop the image.
